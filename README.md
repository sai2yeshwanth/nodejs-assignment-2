# nodejs-assignment-2
creating node servier using express js
1. create a npm project and install Express.js (Nodemon if you want).
2. create an Express.js app which funnels the requests through 2 middleware functions that log something to the console and return one response.
3. Handle requests to "/" and "/users" such that each request only has one handler/ middleware that doses somrthing with it (e.g. send dummy response).
